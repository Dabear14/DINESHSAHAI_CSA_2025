### Key Tips

- Go for a more project-based approach (ie. try more projects/different types of projects)  
- Everything in college is very organized and the methodology is concrete. When starting a project make sure there is a clear gameplan  
- Try to be more technical during reviews to show your understanding of new concepts (even if they aren't completely done yet)  
- Clear, concise and direct communication is very important when doing a live review or talking to a recruiter/interviewer. Rehearse pitches and focus on only showcasing areas of interest  
- Using agile methodology and making diagrams/visuals to support your ideas makes your vision more clear and organized and makes you more organized  
- Comments are very important in college to show mastery. Add more comments to PBL work  
- Community colleges classes are helpful to remove requirements in college  
- Recruiters look at your projects and technical skills rather than your GPA. More important to prioritize projects/technical skills. Take the time to learn how things from CSA can be translated to other areas
