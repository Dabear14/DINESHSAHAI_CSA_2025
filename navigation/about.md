Hi! My name is Dinesh Sahai, I am a senior at Del Norte High School and I am taking CSA. A little about my experience with programming. I first began coding for my local CyberPatriot team (CyberAegis) where I used WSL as part of my workflow on the leadership team. I also learned about bash scripting and learned the fundamentals of coding there. Since then, I've interned at UCLA and worked with deep learning algorithms in python. I have broaded my experience to bioinformatics research with the internships I've completed and I am hoping to pursue a career using the skills I will develop in CSA!
