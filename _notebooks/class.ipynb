    "\n",
    "Here’s a breakdown of the fixes I made in Version 2 to clean up the errors from Version 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`canSeat` Method:**\n",
    "   - In Version 1, the calculation of `totalSeats` forgot to subtract 2 for the shared seats between the tables. This was a logic error because the overlapping seats should not be double-counted. I fixed it by adding `- 2` to the calculation.\n",
    "   - The conditional check used `numPeople < totalSeats`, which didn’t include the case where the number of people equals the total seats. I updated it to `numPeople <= totalSeats` to make it inclusive, as it should be.\n",
    "2. **`getDesirability` Method:**\n",
    "   - The `if` condition in Version 1 was backwards! It checked if the heights of the two tables were not equal (`!=`), but it should’ve been checking if they were equal (`==`). I flipped the condition to fix this.\n",
    "   - When the heights weren’t equal, Version 1 didn’t apply the penalty of subtracting 10 from the desirability score. I corrected that in the `else` block to match the intended behavior."
